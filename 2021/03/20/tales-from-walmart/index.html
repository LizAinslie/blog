<p>This is a new thing I have been wanting to do for a while. I work at a local Walmart Neighborhood Market and by God, some of the stuff that happens is just crazy. Of course this is mostly written as a recap and always written from a non-agressive standpoint, whether it be humorous or annoying or just plain confusing. I’ll try to write these somewhat frequently, but this one will likely be longer as there is a lot more material I have to utilize from the past 5 months. Of course, not all that material will go into this one post, but more of it should appear in later ones.</p>

<h2 id="eggs-with-a-pavement-wish">Eggs with a Pavement Wish</h2>
<p>So I clock out at the end of the day yesterday, and grab a carton of eggs. (a local farm gives some walmart associates the extra eggs or some shit. I dunno I just get eggs) On my way out, I walk up to Daniel, who I have been joking with all day, and say “suck an SSD”. His response was “I hope you drop your eggs in the parking lot and out of reflex kick them to break the fall” and I lost it. I just about started howling like a hyena. I could barely utter “That is literally the most douchebag thing you could’ve possibly said.”</p>

<h2 id="the-antisocial-club">The Antisocial Club</h2>
<p>The day before yesterday, I monitored self checkouts all day. I went to clean the far left one and a dude walks up, sets his stuff down and I go “How are you today?”. Without saying a word, the dude <em>immediately</em> picked his stuff up off the belt and walked to the far end of the self checkouts to begin checking out, all the while looking over his shoulder to make sure we weren’t watching him. Spoiler alert: we were.</p>

<h2 id="tale-of-10000-bananas-not-actually">Tale of 10,000 Bananas (Not Actually)</h2>
<p>So, in the first week or so I worked at Walmart, I had a dude come through the self checkouts and ring up 10 bananas, each on its own transaction. I was thinking “Either this dude’s a legend or he’s incredibly stupid.” It turned out to be a little bit of both: he was a legend because he was able to do it all masterfully without an issue, and he was incredibly stupid because the reason he was doing it was because apparently some credit card companies give you some amount of cash if you make a certain amount of transactions each month. Uhh, hello? The Google Play store exists for a reason.</p>

<h2 id="grand-theft-asparagus">Grand Theft Asparagus</h2>
<p>About early February, I was monitoring self checkouts, and my coworker Judah, who was monitoring the other half of the self checkouts, comes over and says “So we just had grand theft asparagus over here.” I cracked up and asked him to clarify. He goes “Well they walked out with $20 worth of asparagus after ringing it up”. Yeah, That much asparagus should last them quite some time.</p>
