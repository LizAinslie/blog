<p>A name is the most important part of who you are. Without a name, you are nobody. If nobody knows your name, you’re nobody. But the right name can make all the difference. That’s why it’s difficult changing it, but when you’re transgender it is often a necessary change to make. For me, I went from Landon (my given name) to Liz, which is my preferred name. It’s taken a lot of getting used to but I am gaining more confidence with it every day.</p>

        <h1 id="the-importance-of-a-name">The Importance of a Name</h1>
<p>A name is the most important part of who you are. Without a name, you are nobody. If nobody knows your name, you’re nobody. But the right name can make all the difference. That’s why it’s difficult changing it, but when you’re transgender it is often a necessary change to make. For me, I went from Landon (my given name) to Liz, which is my preferred name. It’s taken a lot of getting used to but I am gaining more confidence with it every day.</p>

<h1 id="the-change">The Change</h1>
<p>When picking a new name, I wanted to keep my first initial the same so I had an L name. I started rattling off names until I found one I really liked - Liz. I thought “How does this represent me?” then I came up with the fact that “Liz” is also the start to the word “lizard”, and lizards are cute (like I hope to be) and resilient (like I am emotionally). I thought this represented me pretty well, so I went with it.</p>

<h1 id="my-name-tag">My Name Tag</h1>
<p>I got a new name tag today with my new name on it. I also let everyone at work know my preferred name and my she/her pronoun preference. The euphoric vibes didn’t stop all day and still haven’t. Here’s a picture of my new name tag:</p>

            <p>Welcome to my little corner of the internet! Here, I write about whatever I feel like writing. I mostly enjoy writing about tech, humor, and music, but I try not to limit myself to just a few things. I am transgender (MTF), and 18 years of age.</p>
