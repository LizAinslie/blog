        <h1>Brain Mush</h1>
        <p>In the past, I used to go in and out of cycles where I would make software for so long, and then the other part of the year I would primarily play games. The past year or so has been different. I haven’t been able to motivate myself to do anything code-related and I feel like a large part of that is lack of motivation from my depression, and possibly the fact that for most of the year I was working a day job that killed me.</p>

<p>On top of all this, I’ve started doing cannabis in the form of smoking and edibles to help cope with the fact that I’m just not the same. Self-deprecating humor is a very prevalent coping mechanism, too. It doesn’t help that my family is extremely abusive and I’m struggling to pay rent with a roommate. Oh and I quit my job, so no income. I wouldn’t have lasted anyway.</p>

<p>It’s to the point where my brain is so fucked from the trauma I have had that my sense of time has warped dramatically; I’m worried my brain might just be beyond repair. I also don’t remember a lot of the things I used to, like my memory is just failing. My short-term memory is also bad. Basic logic is also becoming difficult.</p>

<p>I’m also feeling as if there is nothing I can do to be successful. The only time I feel happy is when others are happy because of me or what I do; I think I’ve lost all forms of self-gratification. This makes motivating myself to do things extremely hard. Loneliness is like gasoline in this infinite blaze of pain that just makes it bigger and worse.</p>

<p>I applied (and got accepted) to local community college, so that’s nice I guess. When I announced the news to my parents, Dad was semi-excited but more concerned about what it meant for his wallet, and Mom just said “Well you’re probably just going to fail anyway”.</p>

<p>I guess I just don’t know where to go from here. If you have any ideas of software I could work on, I’m <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Lizzy A#0001</code> on Discord so tell me, I guess. I could use a distraction while I lose my mind.</p>

            <p>Welcome to my little corner of the internet! Here, I write about whatever I feel like writing. I mostly enjoy writing about tech, humor, and music, but I try not to limit myself to just a few things. I am transgender (MTF), and 18 years of age.</p>
