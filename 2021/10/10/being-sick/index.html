        <meta name='description' content='<p>I am sick as a dog right now. It’s actually difficult to write because I don’t get much time in between bathroom breaks or blowing my nose. Fact is, I don’t get sick very easily and right now I am showing COVID symptoms. <em>I’m vaccinated.</em> It’s not often that I write anything political, but this warrants a little bit of analysis.</p>

<p>But, you know who isn’t vaccinated and also happens to work at Walmart? My rooommate. His reasoning is the standard “I want to know what they’re putting in my body” bullshit. It’s the “Oh I’m not a sheep” thinking that kills me the most. So you’re going to reject an FDA-approved vaccine because you think taking it will classify you as a sheep? I’m sorry, but not taking it simply because people you agree with tell you not to IS WHAT A SHEEP DOES.</p>

<p>At some point, getting vaccinated needs to not be about politics and it needs to be about saving people’s fucking lives. I am going to the pharmacy where I got my vaccination to request another card, just in case I have to go to the ER. The only reason I wanta copy of my vax card is that some places are finally doing what they shouldv’e done a long time ago and refusing people who aren’t vaccinated beds. I will also get tested, just to make sure.</p>

<p>The fact that people put others’ lives at risk because of differences in their political beliefs is astonishing to me. Why? I don’t know, honestly. It isn’t anything new, so it shouldn’t astonish me; I guess I’m just surprised by the scale of it with COVID-19 involved.</p>

<p>And I think I need to elaborate on what makes the “I need to know what they’re putting in my body” argument absolutely worthless. A lot of what the FDA does approve is not safe as it is, yet the same people arguing against the vaccine <strong><em>eat this kind of shit all the time</em></strong>. A solid example is Taco Bell’s beef. That shit <em>barely</em> meets FDA standards and I don’t see these people trying to get Taco Bell shut down.</p>

<p>Another common argument I see (and one my roommate has used) is that the vaccine isn’t 100%. <em>That is how a vaccine works.</em> No vaccine is 100%, and it is proven that the a vaccine greatly reduces the risk of catching it, the symptoms <em>and</em> the risk of death from the disease. I don’t remember the exact statistics but I encourage everyone reading this to do their own research because that is how we keep information in check. <em>It’s called fact-checking. Learn how to do it and do it properly for the love of god.</em></p>

<p>At the end of the day, if you do not want to get a COVID-19 vaccine, it is <strong>your</strong> decision. BUT, if you go outside without a mask, stay the fuck away from the rest of us who are doing our part to keep this virus from spreading. Herd immunity is a thing. I heard an interesting analogy that goes something like “If all of your friends told you to jump off a cliff would you?” being used as an argument against the vaccine, and my response is this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>No. What you refer to is backwards thinking anyways. <em>You are actively jumping off a cliff while being told not to.</em> You may think “Fine, my life my decision”, but you also fail to understand that you are tied to everybody else, and everyone is on the edge of this cliff. If enough of you motherfuckers jump, <em>you pull all the rest of us down with you.</em></p>
