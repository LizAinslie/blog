        <h1>Leveling Up</h1>
        <p>I always thought I’d spend the entirety of my days lonely and depressed. I might’ve been wrong.</p>

<p>When I was younger, it was extremely difficult for me to imagine myself having a significant other. I didn’t have any friends as it was, so I decided dating would belong on the back burner. In my sophomore year of high school, that began to change. I moved to public school and almost immediately started making friends. I also found the internet.</p>

<p>When I first signed up for Discord, I never expected it to become as big of a part of my life as it is. To be fair, I didn’t really know much about the internet then. (I learned pretty quickly) Since I have been on Discord, I have made more friends than I could ever imagine myself having as a kid.</p>

<p>Well, let’s cut to the chase. I won’t be using actual names for privacy reasons.</p>

<p>A while back, I joined a Discord for Minecraft shaders. I met a certain person there who I really enjoyed talking to. I then distanced myself from the server because of how poorly managed it was. Well… I’m also in a lot of servers revolving around the OptiFine community, and I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the certain someone from the shader server had joined a small private server I was in.</p>

<p>After a few voice chats, I began to feel something special… it’s hard to describe, but I describe it more or less as a crush. So I wrote a small C++ program to print a message to standard output, with these lines:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>I might have a crush on you...
I know this isn't too impressive but my creativity is nonexistent :)
 - Lizzy
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I then sent it to him, and had him run it. My anxiety has kicked in by this time. We talked in DM, and he said he likes to go slowly with this kind of thing, which I am perfectly okay with. We decided to stay friends for the time, and move ahead from there.</p>

<p>The next night it was voice chat again. We spend about 6 hours exchanging memes and laughing way too hard at some of them. But at the end of the call, it was time for him to go to bed. Here’s a blurred screenshot of our DM.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/screenshots/2021-01/discord_0001.png" alt="The DM" /></p>

<p>It may not seem like much, but the thing about this is, I’ve never met a person who likes me for me. The feeling of happiness still hasn’t gone away.</p>

<p>All of this being said, what’s going on is in its very early stages. I’m currently playing it by ear and moving forward one step at a time. But it’s given me hope, which is more of what this post is about.</p>
