        <h1>Moving Out</h1>
        <p>My parents have been threatening to kick me out for a while. It started when I was 17 and now that I’m 18 they have been more incessant about it. I found some roommates but we’re still looking for an apartment. Long story short, my parents finally freaked out a week ago and pulled the stunt. I ended up contacting my roommates and saying “Hey, can I stay with you guys a bit earlier than planned?” and I have been staying with them for a while.</p>

<h2 id="my-living-situation">My Living Situation</h2>
<p>So, my roommates (Wes And Michaela) are two married high school friends of mine, and they live with Wes’s family (who will be referred to by their initials). In their house are five other humans, four cats, and one dog. That makes eight humans including myself, and the animals. I’m currently sleeping in the fireplace room on a roll up bed. I have my basic necessities, and a car which I will discuss in a bit.</p>

<h2 id="the-car">The Car</h2>
<p>So, my parents let me use a 2011 Chevy Aveo that used to be their business car to get around, but they made a very big deal about not letting me use it after moving out. Wes’s dad works around cars a lot and gets some good deals on vehicles. He happened to have an old Mercury Sable sitting around and offered to sell it to me on a pay-as-I-go basis for a total of $800 over four months. I took the offer and am currently using the car to get around.</p>

<h2 id="downtime">Downtime</h2>
<p>During my downtime, I have gone to the mall with Q (Wes’s nonbinary sibling) and Michaela, or I have helped Michaela with her blog, among other things (i.e. playing games). Today we went shopping at the 5 Below store and I got some perfume, then we went to the mall where I got some tights which are the cutest and most comfortable things I think I have ever worn. The feminine stuff I’m trying has also helped a lot with my dysphoria. Another thing that helped was that I got my ears pierced, which is cool. If you’re wondering what the fragrance is, it’s “Pink Candy”. A coworker of mine wears it and I had to ask “Where on earth did you get this and what is it called” because it’s such a good fragrance.</p>

<h2 id="wess-mom">Wes’s Mom</h2>
<p>Wes’s mom is, let’s say… special. She has her fair share of issues getting along with people, especially Q and Michaela. She seems to be okay with calling me by my preferred pronouns and name, but won’t respect those of Q, who is nonbinary and prefers they/them pronouns. Wes’s mom also has trouble treating Michaela kindly and that causes Michaela a lot of stress, not to mention strains the relationship. She also has trouble getting along with Wes’s younger brother, S. The only one she tends to get along with is R, Wes’s younger sister.</p>
