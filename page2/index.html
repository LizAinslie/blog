<p>A name is the most important part of who you are. Without a name, you are nobody. If nobody knows your name, you’re nobody. But the right name can make all the difference. That’s why it’s difficult changing it, but when you’re transgender it is often a necessary change to make. For me, I went from Landon (my given name) to Liz, which is my preferred name. It’s taken a lot of getting used to but I am gaining more confidence with it every day.

<p>This is a new thing I have been wanting to do for a while. I work at a local Walmart Neighborhood Market and by God, some of the stuff that happens is just crazy. Of course this is mostly written as a recap and always written from a non-agressive standpoint, whether it be humorous or annoying or just plain confusing. I’ll try to write these somewhat frequently, but this one will likely be longer as there is a lot more material I have to utilize from the past 5 months. Of course, not all that material will go into this one post, but more of it should appear in later ones.

                <p>So, a while back, I created a moderately popular app called MyRPC. (It’s dead now) Essentially, it was a custom status application for Discord based on the RPC function of Discord. At the time of its creation, my knowledge was mostly of Node.js, so I opted to use Electron. The earliest versions of the code worked spectacularly, and the app was a  hit. However, I learned React at some point, and decided that MyRPC could use a touch of React. Bearing in mind that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">create-react-app</code> was essentially the only way to do React at the time (unless you wanted to configure everything manually), I opted to use it.
