The past few weeks have gone really well for me. I started doing freelance software dev, met a lot of great people, and honestly life has felt a lot better. Now I have an actual job lined up and things are looking good. The folks at [Studio Archetype](https://studioarchetype.net) are great people to work with!

Yesterday was different... I woke up with PTSD-inducing flashbacks from my childhood, which arguably wasn't great. I'll spare you the details but it took me so long to get out of bed that I missed the fun day I had planned with a friend. Throughout the day I continued to have these flashbacks and it hasn't felt good. I also confessed to my crush yesterday and have not recieved a response which kind of made it harder, but that's okay; everybody needs time.

This morning at 00:30 I went on a drive to clear my head, which is something I haven't had to do in months. When I used to do it I would speed pretty heavily and I'd be out for a long time, but this time I just kinda cruised around town for 30 minutes. It's 01:27 at the time of this sentence and I really don't know what's going on. My plan is to sleep and hopefully tomorrow will be easier.
