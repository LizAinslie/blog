In the past, I used to go in and out of cycles where I would make software for so long, and then the other part of the year I would primarily play games. The past year or so has been different. I haven't been able to motivate myself to do anything code-related and I feel like a large part of that is lack of motivation from my depression, and possibly the fact that for most of the year I was working a day job that killed me.

On top of all this, I've started doing cannabis in the form of smoking and edibles to help cope with the fact that I'm just not the same. Self-deprecating humor is a very prevalent coping mechanism, too. It doesn't help that my family is extremely abusive and I'm struggling to pay rent with a roommate. Oh and I quit my job, so no income. I wouldn't have lasted anyway.

It's to the point where my brain is so fucked from the trauma I have had that my sense of time has warped dramatically; I'm worried my brain might just be beyond repair. I also don't remember a lot of the things I used to, like my memory is just failing. My short-term memory is also bad. Basic logic is also becoming difficult.

I'm also feeling as if there is nothing I can do to be successful. The only time I feel happy is when others are happy because of me or what I do; I think I've lost all forms of self-gratification. This makes motivating myself to do things extremely hard. Loneliness is like gasoline in this infinite blaze of pain that just makes it bigger and worse.

I applied (and got accepted) to local community college, so that's nice I guess. When I announced the news to my parents, Dad was semi-excited but more concerned about what it meant for his wallet, and Mom just said "Well you're probably just going to fail anyway".

I guess I just don't know where to go from here. If you have any ideas of software I could work on, I'm `Lizzy A#0001` on Discord so tell me, I guess. I could use a distraction while I lose my mind.
