                <p>The past few weeks have gone really well for me. I started doing freelance software dev, met a lot of great people, and honestly life has felt a lot better. Now I have an actual job lined up and things are looking good. The folks at <a href="https://studioarchetype.net">Studio Archetype</a> are great people to work with!

                <p>I am sick as a dog right now. It’s actually difficult to write because I don’t get much time in between bathroom breaks or blowing my nose. Fact is, I don’t get sick very easily and right now I am showing COVID symptoms. <em>I’m vaccinated.</em> It’s not often that I write anything political, but this warrants a little bit of analysis.

                <p>In the past, I used to go in and out of cycles where I would make software for so long, and then the other part of the year I would primarily play games. The past year or so has been different. I haven’t been able to motivate myself to do anything code-related and I feel like a large part of that is lack of motivation from my depression, and possibly the fact that for most of the year I was working a day job that killed me.

                <p>My parents have been threatening to kick me out for a while. It started when I was 17 and now that I’m 18 they have been more incessant about it. I found some roommates but we’re still looking for an apartment. Long story short, my parents finally freaked out a week ago and pulled the stunt. I ended up contacting my roommates and saying “Hey, can I stay with you guys a bit earlier than planned?” and I have been staying with them for a while.

                <p>This past week has been hell for me, and I’ll cut to the chase: I don’t really know where I am going from here. I don’t really even know how to start writing about it, but I’ll do my best. It is also important to note that this is my side of the equation, and not meant to harm anyone at all. Essentially, I’m just venting.
